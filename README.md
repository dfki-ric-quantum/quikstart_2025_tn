# MPS for unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository contains two notebooks from the QUIKSTART X 2025 winterschool.

* `opt_einsum.ipynb` demonstrates the usage of `opt_einsum`
* `MPS_MNIST_8x8_example.ipynb` is an end-to-end example for an unsupervised learning task on a
simple data set with an MPS

To install the required python packages, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

A lot more details and explanations can be found in the notebooks.
